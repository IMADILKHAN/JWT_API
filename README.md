JWT_API
-----
(Creating an ci/cd pipeline)
### Introduction
This is an sample project used to create an CI/CD [Continious Dntegration / Continious Delivery] pipeline on aws.
A docker image of the project can also be found on https://hub.docker.com/r/imadilkhan/fsnd2.

The api does the following things
- `GET '/'`: This is a simple health check, which returns the response 'Healthy'. 
- `POST '/auth'`: This takes a email and password as json arguments and returns a JWT based on a custom secret.
- `GET '/contents'`: This requires a valid JWT, and returns the un-encrpyted contents of that token. 

The app relies on a secret set as the environment variable `JWT_SECRET` to produce a JWT. The built-in Flask server is adequate for local development, but not production, so you will be using the production-ready [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) server when deploying the app.
